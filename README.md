## Documentation

CKFinder is composed of two parts: the client-side part and the server-side connector(s).

The client-side part is written in JavaScript and is common across all distributions (PHP and ASP.NET, Java in the future), while
the server-side parts are different for each language. There are thus multiple CKFinder 3 documentation websites available.
